Architect AI is a full-stack, real-time resume generation and analysis tool. It combines a blazing-fast live preview interface with the analytical power of Google's Gemini API to act as a strict, constructive Applicant Tracking System (ATS). 

Built with an emphasis on rapid prototyping and clean architecture, this application allows users to dynamically craft their professional profiles, score them against target roles, and manage their sessions securely.

* **🔗 Auto-Formatting Links:** Social inputs automatically convert into styled, clickable hyperlinks in the final document.
* **🖨️ Native PDF Export:** Custom `@media print` CSS ensures flawless, A4-perfect PDF exports with a single click, automatically saving with the candidate's name.

cd Architect-AI
2. Install dependencies

Code snippet
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key
4. Fire it up

💡 Usage Guide
Account Creation: Sign up for an account to access the builder. First-time setup creates a default Admin account (admin@admin.com / admin@123).

Select a Template: Use the dropdown on the left to choose a base design. The preview on the right will update instantly.

Input Data: Fill out your personal details, education, and projects. Watch the resume build itself in real-time. Leave fields blank to hide them.

Analyze: Set your target role and company at the top of the form, then click ATS Analyzer. Gemini will evaluate your profile and provide a score.

External Resumes: Inside the ATS Analyzer modal, you can upload an existing PDF resume to bypass the live form and have Gemini analyze the document directly.

Export: Click Export PDF to save your masterpiece.
